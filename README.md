# Conventions

A collection of personal rules and preferences I use for my projects.  

## Version Control

Refuse to work with someone who refuse to use Git.  
(Except when under the poverty line and need to survive the winter)

Follow the conventional commits (aka the Angular convention).  
More specifically, as described in [conventional_commit_messages.md].  
Below are notable tips and caveats:

- Imperative, as if you are [giving orders to the codebase][SubmittingPatches]
- Present tense ("add", not "added")
- DO NOT capitalize the first letter
- DO NOT add period `.` at the end
